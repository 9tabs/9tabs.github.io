When starting out as a developer, the amount of content to sift through seems unmanagable. Many
experienced developers are quick to make absurd recommendations such as [The Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://goo.gl/bSX9nm) or [The Art of Computer
Programming](https://goo.gl/KSwvDG). While these may be excellent books, they're not intended to
quickly introduce concepts that are necessary for creating fun and interesting software.

I've done my best to curate the books that kept me interested in software development when I was
first starting out. I have to thank the authors mentioned below for introducing me to the lucrative
and exciting world of software engineering.

## 1. [The C Programming Language](https://goo.gl/opSC7A) by Kernighan and Ritchie
[The C Programming Language](https://goo.gl/opSC7A) by Brian Kernighan is a foundational book in
software engineering. Even if you're not interested in embedded systems programming, learning the
basics of C is critical for an intuitive understanding of how a computer works.

Many modern languages and design patterns will often (but not always) relieve you from the
responsibilities of managing memory, directly interfacing with the operating system, or dealing with
types. While these modern conveniences are usually worth the runtime performance tradeoff, having a
working knowledge of C will give you an intuition for how other languages, such as
[Python](https://github.com/python/cpython), are implemented. Since most embedded software,
including the Linux kernel, is implemented in C, having a strong grasp of the language opens up a
large set of career opportunities.

## 2. [Head First Java](http://amzn.to/2Bhl5gF) by Bates and Sierra
[Head First Java](http://amzn.to/2Bhl5gF) has a special place in my heart because it was the first
book I found that made programming seem approachable and fun. It’s a really thick book, weighing in
at 688 pages and 3.1 pounds, but you can breeze through it pretty quickly because a large percentage
of the content is presented in the form of cheeky cartoons used to demonstrate various concepts of
Java programming.

My favorite thing about this book is that the authors seemed truly obsessed with making it
impossible to *not* understand the material. I can almost guarantee that anyone who finishes this
book will have a solid takeaway, regardless of your age or background. If you’re interested in
learning Java as a first programming language, I cannot recommend this book enough.

## 3. [Head First Design Patterns](http://amzn.to/2zdb7eA) by Freeman and Sierra
Usually a book on design patterns wouldn't be on a list for beginners, but this one in particular is
so beginner friendly that it would be a disservice to not mention it. Typically, people bring up the
famous [Gang of Four (GoF)](http://amzn.to/9BhysgR) book, which is a jam-packed, no-nonsense
reference manual of design patterns. [Head First Design Patterns](http://amzn.to/2zdb7eA), on the
other hand, is a light introduction to design patterns for a novice software developer.

If I were teaching software development to someone who was looking to become a professional Java or
Android developer in a short period of time, this would be the second book I would present them
after finishing [Head First Java](http://amzn.to/2Bhl5gF).


## 4. [Code](http://amzn.to/2BfEvmh) by Charles Petzold
[Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](http://amzn.to/2BfEvmh) is a book
about the man behind the curtain of computation. If I had to pick one computer science text to
recommend to friends and family, this would be it. [Code](http://amzn.to/2BfEvmh) takes concepts we
take for granted, such as storing alphanumeric values digitally or performing floating point
arithmetic, and explains them with a bottom-up approach. Petzold takes the magic out of these topics
and replaces it with appreciation and intrigue.

Upon completion of [Code](http://amzn.to/2BfEvmh), you'll have a good understanding of how a
computer converts source code into the machine's native language and how the CPU then executes the
resultant binary. [Code](http://amzn.to/2BfEvmh) is a captivating adventure through the building
blocks of digital computing.


## 5. [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://amzn.to/2Bi6wcU) by Zed Shaw
Zed Shaw has had his share of [bad press](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/11/23/a-rebuttal-for-python-3/).
Nevertheless, his book, Learn Python the Hard Way ([LPTHW](http://amzn.to/2Bi6wcU)), is recognized
by most as being the very best introductory book on Python programming.

[LPTHW](http://amzn.to/2Bi6wcU) will take you from zero knowledge of programming to having enough
familiarity with the language to take advantage its expansive and [easily accessible library
collection](https://pypi.python.org/pypi). After working my way through
[LPTHW](http://amzn.to/2Bi6wcU), I was able to easily write some 2D games using Pygame. I read
[LPTHW](http://amzn.to/2Bi6wcU) when I was a freshman in college and I still recommend it to interns
at my company who are learning Python for the first time.


## 6. [Exploring Arduino](http://amzn.to/2BWA0k5) by Jeremy Blum
Every programmer should play with an Arduino at some point in his or her career. The satisfaction of
manipulating the physical world with code is enough to keep anyone motivated, and it's easier to get
started than one might think. [Exploring Arduino](http://amzn.to/2BWA0k5) by Jeremy Blum is an
excellent introductory text for anyone interested in electrical engineering or embedded software
development. [Exploring Arduino](http://amzn.to/2BWA0k5) does an excellent job of explaining basic
electronics concepts, from motors to shift registers to interfacing with LCDs. Upon completion of
[Exploring Arduino](http://amzn.to/2BWA0k5), you'll have enough confidence with programming Arduinos
to do a wide array of home electronics projects. Plus, you'll learn some basic C programming along
the way.

If you choose to get [Exploring Arduino](http://amzn.to/2BWA0k5), I highly recommend buying [this
starter kit](http://amzn.to/2Ds9bSQ) to ensure that you have all of the parts necessary to work
through the book, since it can be pretty frustrating waiting for hardware between chapters.


## 7. [The Linux Programming Interface](http://amzn.to/2CTZR95) by Michael Kerrisk

I picked up [The Linux Programming Interface](http://amzn.to/2CTZR95) after being hired onto an
embedded software engineering team after obtaining my degree. I quickly worked through all of the
exercises in the book, gaining more and more confidence with the Linux API as I progressed through
the book. If you're curious how basic tools such as `cat` or `tee` are implemented or you want to
learn network programming in C, [The Linux Programming Interface](http://amzn.to/2CTZR95) is an
incredible book to have by your side. Although this book's focus is interfacing with the Linux API,
this book has incredible depth and breadth, thoroughly explaining topics such as memory mapping,
concurrency, race conditions, message queues, networking protocols, shared objects, and more.

For such a comprehensive book on such a wide variety of topics, [TLPI](http://amzn.to/2CTZR95) is
shockingly approachable even for a software engineer in the beginning stages of his or her career.
