Contributing to open source software is intimidating. The good news is that many projects and
organizations constantly make valiant efforts to welcome new contributors. Thanks to various
community initiatives, making open source contributions is easier today than ever before. Starting
from scratch, you can make your first contribution *today*.

Making contributions in 2018 will not only help you hone your skills (both technical and
interpersonal), but it will also build your credibility, open career doors, and win you the
affection and admiration of your cutest coworker, guaranteed. Plus, having significant contributions
on your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account automatically lands your resume in the *sexy* pile.

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisite for making contributions is that you must have the tools necessary to make a
change request. For most open source projects, this means having basic familiarity with git. Git can
be *really easy* if you spend some time learning how to use it or it can be *really frustrating* if
you use the google-as-you-go method. I highly recommend [Pro Git](http://amzn.to/2DJSBNC), which is
available for [free](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). GitHub also has a 15 minute [interactive
guide](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) which makes learning Git very approachable.

Once you're comfortable with the foundational concepts of commits, branches, forks, etc., you'll
have enough working knowledge to make your first contribution. Just don't fall into the trap of
thinking you need to know *everything* before you can do *anything*.

## Picking a Project

Choosing software to make your first contribution to is like choosing a band name: the longer you
spend deliberating, the more likely you are to abandon the idea altogether. I recommend checking out
[up-for-grabs.net](http://www.up-for-grabs.net), which makes it really easy to find projects that
are looking for new contributors. Try searching for technologies that you enjoy using; Rust, React,
Redux, and Visual Studio Code all have related projects that are looking for love.

GitHub also has a [list of projects that are great for new
contributors](https://github.com/showcases/great-for-new-contributors). Quite a few of these projects
have an explicit [Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) that mandates being a
decent human being, a topic that still remains controversial. You're very likely to find a
technology or community that you love on [that
list](https://github.com/showcases/great-for-new-contributors).

## Breaking the Seal

At the interest of empowering first-timer contributors, the friendly folks over at
[firsttimersonly.com](https://www.firsttimersonly.com) have put forth an initiative to curate simple
tasks for people who have *never made an open source contribution before*. Most of the changes that
appear on [their GitHub label filter](https://goo.gl/NvSmtb) are easy enough that anyone can do
them.

The great thing about this project is that, even though the changes are trivial, it gives an
opportunity for first-time contributors to familiarize themselves with the change request workflow.
Once you've made a contribution, you'll have the confidence needed to attack more challenging
problems.

## Staying Motivated
The best way to stay motivated is to get started... right now. No matter how much code you've written
in your career, nothing beats the satisfaction of a project maintainer thanking you for your change
and knowing that others are benefiting from your contribution.

Making more contributions to open source software is one of my New Year's resolutions for 2018, so
join me in making it a year of friendly, wholesome collaboration.
